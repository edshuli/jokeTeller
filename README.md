### About
<hr>

*This website was created as part of my course at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/?utm_source=bing-brand&utm_medium=udemyads&utm_campaign=BG-Brand-Udemy_la.EN_cc.ROW&utm_term=_._ag_1219358808134939_._ad__._de_c_._dm__._pl__._ti_kwd-76210237821084_._li_2484_._pd__._&utm_term=_._pd__._kw_udemy%2B_._&matchtype=e&msclkid=a8cb22e88b6e14c02a4b7d3f06cd0006">Udemy JavaScript Course</a>.*

*The purpose of it, is to entertain the users with funny and geeky jokes, especially these very difficult times we are living in. I wanted to help also in some way and that is the reason why I created this website. I hope it will make your day.*

The site contains the following:

* Button where you call an API to get a random joke.
* And a nice litle animated gif robot.

*The technologies we used to create the website are the follow:*

<a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/"> **HTML 5** </a> : Markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.

<a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/Email.html"> **CSS 3** </a>: Style the web documents

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">**JavaScript**</a>: used to program the behavior of Web pages.

*In order to get the joke, I followed the below steps:* 

* Call <a href="https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/">**Joke API**</a> to get a random joke.
* Then we pass that to <a href="http://www.voicerss.org/api/">**Text-to-Speech API**</a>, which will tell us the joke.

*We took the little robot from:* <a href="https://giphy.com/">**Giphy.com**</a>
